	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a Rich Media Designer, living in London. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because of my current job role. I first became interested in everything creative when I was modelling.  During this time I was lucky enough to build friendships with the creative teams on set who allowed me to view their work and see 'behind the scenes'. This gave me my first glimpse of digital media! I went on to take double Media Studies at GCSE and then onto a Creative Media Production Level 3 Diploma course. I completed this course, resulting Distinction* across Photography/Art & Design, Music Technology and TV & Film, which landed me my job at Adform.</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one-day work as a Senior Rich Media Designer with Adform. With this senior role I would like to be head of the Rich Media department, with a team of my own, creating a fun, friendly and social environment to productively achieve all of our goals and aspirations.</p>
